      "description": "A recently dumped TV heartthrob enlists a jaded romance novelist to ruin romance for him--one rom-com trope at a time--so he never gets swept off his feet again . . .\n\nSawyer Greene knows romance. She's a bestselling author of the genre--or she was, until her ex left her with nothing but writer's block and a broken heart. But when she gets stuck in the elevator with a handsome stranger, she sees their meet cute for what it is: just a one-night stand. It might have worked, too, if they could stop running into each other.\nActor Mason West sees Sawyer's reappearance in his life as a sign. Obviously, they're meant to cure each other. Him of the hopeless romanticism that only ends in heartbreak--and tabloid trainwrecks--and Sawyer of her writer's block. Their agreement is simple: 1. No (more) sex, and 2. No matter how swoony the circumstances, absolutely no falling in love.\nIt's a foolproof plan-until Sawyer and Mason find that, once set in motion, some plots can't be stopped--and that they might be hurtling towards a happy ending...",

Silver working--the art of manifesting the meaning lost in translation using enchanted silver bars--has made the British unparalleled in power, as its knowledge serves the Empire's quest for colonization.\n\nFor Robin, Oxford is a utopia dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. But knowledge obeys power, and as a Chinese boy raised in Britain, Robin realizes serving Babel means betraying his motherland. As his studies progress, Robin finds himself caught between Babel and the shadowy Hermes Society, an organization dedicated to stopping imperial expansion. When Britain pursues an unjust war with China over silver and opium, Robin must decide...\n\nCan powerful institutions be changed from within, or does revolution always require violence?",
